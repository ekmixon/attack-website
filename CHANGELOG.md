# March 31, 2020
## ATT&CK Website version 2.0
### New Features
- Added sub-techniques.
    - Added pages for sub-techniques. Sub-technique pages are found under their parent technique, e.g /techniques/T####/###. Sub-technique names and IDs are prefixed with that of their parent technique. Otherwise they are largely formatted like techniques. See issue [#23](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/23).
    - Added sub-technique listing card to techniques with sub-techniques. See issue [#24](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/24).
    - Updated techniques used/mitigated lists to differentiate sub-techniques and techniques. See issue [#25](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/25).
    - Added sub-techniques to side-navigation and technique/tactic lists. See issue [#26](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/26).
    - Updated FAQ with sub-technique information. See issue [#41](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/41).
    - Updated ATT&CK Matrix layout to support sub-techniques.
        - Two layouts of the matrix are available:
            - the "side" layout (default), where sub-techniques appear in an adjacent sub-column of the tactic.
            - the "flat" layout, where sub-techniques appear nested beneath their parent similar to an indented list.
        The control to toggle between them appears only when sub-techniques are present in the matrix. 
        - Sub-techniques can be hidden and shown under their parent by clicking the gray sidebar. 
        - Show-all / hide-all buttons were added to show/hide all sub-techniques. See issue [#43](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/43).
        - Added "help" button to matrices which plays the matrix portion of the sub-technique tour. See issue [#28](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/28).
    - Added sub-technique support for technique usage ATT&CK Navigator layers on group and software pages. See issue [#29](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/29).
- Added the "take a tour" feature. The tour feature guides the user through the sub-technique changes. Click "take a tour" on the homepage or follow [this link](https://attack.mitre.org/?tour=true) to start the tour automatically. See issue [#28](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/28).

### Improvements

    - Page content except for the deprecation warning now omitted to discourage continued use
    - Now hidden from search (both ours and search engines')
    - No longer found in technique lists, etc
- ATT&CK Archives now allows for archived versions to be "retired." Retired versions are removed from the /previous/ directory and replaced with links to the raw data and HTML. See issue [#102](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/102).
- Lists within data cards, e.g the platforms of a technique, are now in alphabetical order. See issue [#84](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/84).
- Matrix timestamps are now calculated from the modified date on the x-mitre-matrix STIX object. Additionally, said timestamps are now formatted the same as modified dates on other pages of the website. See issue [#27](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/27).
- Revisions to the layout of the matrix pages to improve readability when multiple matrices occur within a domain.

## [ATT&CK Content version 7.0-beta](https://github.com/mitre/cti/releases/tag/ATT%26CK-v7.0-beta)
See release notes [here](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-march-2020/index.html).

# 17 June 2020
## ATT&CK Website version 1.3.1
### Fixes
- Fixed navigator links on groups and software pages that were repeating the domain on the URI. See issues [#169](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/169) and [#192](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/192).

# 10 June 2020
## ATT&CK Website version 1.3
This update includes a major refactor of the ATT&CK catalog versioning system, previously referred to as "previous versions."

- Versions have been moved from `/previous/monthYear` to `/versions/v#` which should be more predictable and consistent with the way the versions are referred to elsewhere. Redirects have been created so that users who bookmarked the old URLs will get sent to the new ones. See issue [#174](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/174).
- Added a permalink to the current version of the site. See issue [#175](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website/issues/175).
    - Current version is preserved alongside other versions in `/versions/`.
    - Object pages on the live website now have a "version permalink" leading to a frozen version of that page.
    - Permalink and previous versions now have a "live version" link leading to the most recent version of that page.
- Revised the version list. Find the new version list on the [Versions of ATT&CK page](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/versions), which replaced the "previous versions" page.
    - Now formatted as an easy to read table.
    - Added links to the data on [MITRE/CTI](https://github.com/mitre/cti) for each version.
    - Revised blurb on how versions work to explain our methodology behind the catalog version numbers and versioning system.
- Updated past release notes to mention the version number for each release.
